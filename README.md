# Introduction

NETRE: a new in-network TRE architecture that leverages the power and flexibility of emerging programmable switches to provide on-path detection and elimination of redundant traffic transmission in the networks. In NETRE, a pair of nodes in a routing path cache packets to reduce bandwidth consumption and gain performance revenue. Each pair of cache nodes in the networks maintains per-pair synchronized cache stores to accurately encode and decode the on-the-fly traffics.

We implement NETRE prototype in P4 language for BMv2 simple_switch target and Tofino TNA target.
